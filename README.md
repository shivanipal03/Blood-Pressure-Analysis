# Blood-Pressure-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to analyze and predict blood pressure levels based on various health metrics. By utilizing advanced algorithms, this project seeks to provide accurate assessments that can help in early diagnosis and management of hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions.

# Phases Project Development
1. Data Collection: Gather comprehensive datasets that include patient medical history, lifestyle factors, and historical blood pressure readings.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.

3. Model Development: Develop and train machine learning models using techniques such as regression analysis, random forest, decision trees, GaussianNB, MultinomialNB,  or neural networks to predict blood pressure levels based on input features.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring reliability and validity in predictions.

5. User Interface: Create a user-friendly web application using HTML, CSS, and Flask that allows users to input their health metrics and receive real-time blood pressure predictions and recommendations.
